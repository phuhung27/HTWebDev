After reading the article, the first point that struck me was how dynamic UX is, unlike what some may think about coding - just sitting behind a computer screen and writing codes. There is a lot of teamwork and communications involved to arrive at the final product solution. From talking with the client to sketching out drafts of the wireframes, there is also a lot of planning involved in the process before all the visuals you see on the screen. I have always been very interested in understanding more about UX after being on good websites such as that of Apple's and the process it takes to get there.
